## About this Project
In this repository, we have provided you a REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API project using Rocket web framework.

This project consists of four modules:
1.  `controller`: this module contains handler functions used to receive request and send responses.
    In Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, this is the Controller part.
2.  `model`: this module contains structs that serve as data containers.
    In MVC pattern, this is the Model part.
3.  `service`: this module contains structs with business logic methods.
    In MVC pattern, this is also the Model part.
4.  `repository`: this module contains structs that serve as databases and methods to access the databases.
    You can use methods of the struct to get list of objects, or operating an object (create, read, update, delete).

This repository provides a basic functionality that makes BambangShop work: ability to create, read, and delete `Product`s.
This repository already contains a functioning `Product` model, repository, service, and controllers that you can try right away.

As this is an Observer Design Pattern tutorial repository, you need to implement another feature: `Notification`.
This feature will notify creation, promotion, and deletion of a product, to external subscribers that are interested of a certain product type.
The subscribers are another Rocket instances, so the notification will be sent using HTTP POST request to each subscriber's `receive notification` address.

## API Documentations

You can download the Postman Collection JSON here: https://ristek.link/AdvProgWeek7Postman

After you download the Postman Collection, you can try the endpoints inside "BambangShop Publisher" folder.
This Postman collection also contains endpoints that you need to implement later on (the `Notification` feature).

Postman is an installable client that you can use to test web endpoints using HTTP request.
You can also make automated functional testing scripts for REST API projects using this client.
You can install Postman via this website: https://www.postman.com/downloads/

## How to Run in Development Environment
1.  Set up environment variables first by creating `.env` file.
    Here is the example of `.env` file:
    ```bash
    APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    ```
    Here are the details of each environment variable:
    | variable              | type   | description                                                |
    |-----------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
    | APP_INSTANCE_ROOT_URL | string | URL address where this publisher instance can be accessed. |
2.  Use `cargo run` to run this app.
    (You might want to use `cargo check` if you only need to verify your work without running the app.)

## Your Reflections
This is the place for you to write reflections:

### Mandatory (Publisher) Reflections

#### Reflection Publisher-1
**Is interface still needed?** -- it's technically possible to implement Observer pattern without an interface, but using one provides several advantages in terms of flexibility, maintainability, and testability.

**Use Vec or DashMap?** -- using Vec (list) for this case is sufficient if the numbers of objects inside the Vec is small. If the number is large, it's better to use DashMap since it provides constant-time complexity ($O(1)$) for operations like insertion, deletion, and lookup.

**DashMap or Singleton pattern?** -- DashMap handles concurrency internally, so unless there are specific requirements that make Singleton need to be used, then using DashMap is preferable in Rust.

#### Reflection Publisher-2
**Why Service and Repository needs to be separated from Model?** -- the separation improves the code's maintainability, scalibility, testability, and it follows the fundamental design principles like SRP, SoC, and DRY. The separation allows cleaner code organization, easier maintenance, and better support for evolving requirements in complex software systems.

**What happen if only Model is used?** -- if only model is used, the complexity of each Model (eg: Program, Subscriber, Notification) will increase significantly, the maintainability and modularity will be reduced. Each model will be burdened with mix of domain logic and data access concerns, leading to tangled codes and difficulty in extending or modifying the system. 

**How will Postman help?** -- Postman will help testing out the API endpoints that have been made. It makes the endpoint calling easier so I could see whether my program works as intended or not. The feature I like the most about Postman is the ability to save endpoints as groups so it will be easy to test it, or even automate the endpoint testing.
